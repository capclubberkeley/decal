## About

This course provides an introduction to visual storytelling through motion pictures. No prior experience is required. All you need is a strong interest in filmmaking and enough time to direct a short film. However, if you have already taken production classes such as FILM 185: Intermediate Moving Image Production, FILM 186: Advanced Moving Image Production or are highly experienced in filmmaking, this class may not be an appropriate class for you. Students will encounter the entire process of film production from pre-production to production and post-production. This course can be an opportunity for students to learn the foundations of cinematography, lighting, sound design, and editing.

This course will enhance students' knowledge of the basic filmmaking process through visual storytelling, learning how to direct, and editing. By the end of this course, students will be able to create a variety of lighting setups, capture and process audio on set, and successfully complete a short film

### Enrollment

### Attendance
Attendance will be taken after 10 minutes “Berkeley Time”; you will be marked absent if you are not present at that time so please be on time. Our course is practice-based, which means that missing classes affects the work of other students and can be difficult to make up.If you are feeling sick or extremely stressed, please reach out to one of the instructors and we can give you extra homework or try to figure out the best way to catch up with the class. Students who have more than 2 unexcused absences will get an automatic NP (Non-Pass). 

### Electronics
Students may use their electronic devices (laptop or tablets) to access course materials during lecture, BUT NO electronic devices are permitted during the lab. 			

## Labs
**Talk more about what the labs are here**

Students must wear dark, loose-fitting clothing while using a camera. This will prevent reflections and allow for free movement. Bright colored clothing will reflect in the background and distract shots or actors. Wear dark colored clothing that you can move freely and get dirty which you don’t need to worry too much (Week 2 & 5).
